# Presidential Inaugural Speeches Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the inaugural speeches of three Presidents of the United States using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python. The speeches analyzed are:

1. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's speech in 1941
2. President John F. Kennedy's speech in 1961
3. President Richard Nixon's speech in 1973

The analysis includes calculating the number of characters, words, and sentences in each speech, removing stopwords, identifying the most common words, and creating word clouds for visualization.
